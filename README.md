# RoguelikeMultiplayer

Idea to be started soon:
- roguelike game style: terminal, ascii
- multiplayer capabilities
- client with account management
- email confirmation, login, password
- Diesel ORM for Database
- server + database shipped with containers
- client with [bracket-lib](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/bracket-lib/what_is_it.html)
- openworld - willages to travel to. Traveling probably will be quite fast. Maybe add delays between steps.
- Mining, woodcutting like Runescape + crafting. Trees, ore veins will be probably single colored characters, but inventory itemswill be more verbose (2z2 characters lol)
- dungeons are generated per player (or party in future). aybe some enemies in dungeons, but for sure traps. Light effects, torch and similar. Player will have to find reward chest. COmbat level? How to do this with player looking like this '@' ? Exori #Tibia hah
- player can fainy indungeon similar to stardew valley
- dungeons will require some combat level or skills, lets say woodcutting to access forest dungeon, mining to access mine dungeon. Dungeons willgrant experinace is skills.
